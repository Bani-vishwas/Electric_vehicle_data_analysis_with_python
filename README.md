# Electric Vehicle Data Analysis with Python

This project analyzes a dataset of electric vehicles (EVs) using Python.  
It explores key features such as **electric range, energy consumption, price, and other attributes** to uncover meaningful insights.  

## Project Goals
- Perform data cleaning and preprocessing  
- Conduct exploratory data analysis (EDA) with visualizations  
- Test hypotheses to validate insights  
- Tell a data-driven story through analysis  
- Provide actionable recommendations for EV performance and market trends  

## Tech Stack
- Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn, etc.)  
- Jupyter Notebook / VS Code  
- Git & GitHub for version control  

## How to Run
1. Clone the repository  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/Electric_vehicle_data_analysis_with_python.git
